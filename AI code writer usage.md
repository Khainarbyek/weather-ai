## AI Tools in Development

Building this app was a unique experience, thanks to the help of AI tools that boosted my productivity and simplified complex tasks. Here’s how I used them:

- **Cursor Editor**: This was my first time using Cursor, and it quickly became an essential tool. Its real-time coding suggestions, code completion, and intuitive tab offers made writing code feel seamless. The VSCode-like interface made it easy to adapt, and the Composer feature was invaluable for structuring and improving my code efficiently.

- **ChatGPT**: I relied heavily on ChatGPT for problem-solving and generating code. From backend development with Node.js to crafting AI model instruction texts, ChatGPT made the process smoother. It’s hard to imagine coding in the future without tools like this. 

While AI tools made things easier, some parts—like connecting the backend and frontend with OpenAI’s real-time model—still required a lot of testing and fine-tuning. Despite these challenges, the AI code generation tools helped me write efficient code, including the `README.md` files.

AI tools might not be perfect yet, but they’re already game-changers. If you’re building something similar, I’d highly recommend giving them a try!
